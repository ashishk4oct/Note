In java we have two types of locks available

1. Intrinsic Lock

2. Explicit Lock

Whenever we synchronize any object we get an Intrinsic Lock on that object.

Question is when to use explicit and when to use intrinsic. 
There are many reasons to use explicit reasons. One of them is tryLock() method which helps to prevent the deadlock scenario.

    Separation of locks by read or write.
    Some locks allow concurrent access to a shared resource (ReadWriteLock).
    Different ways of acquiring a lock:
        Blocking: lock()
        Non-blocking: tryLock()
        Interruptible: lockInterruptibly()
