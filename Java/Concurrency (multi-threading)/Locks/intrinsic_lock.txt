In Java, an intrinsic lock is implied by each use of the synchronized keyword

Each use of the synchronized keyword is associated with one of the two types of intrinsic lock:

    an "instance lock", attached to a single object
    a "static lock", attached to a class

Acquiring the instance lock only blocks other threads from invoking a synchronized instance method; it does not block other threads from invoking an un-synchronized method, nor does it block them from invoking a static synchronized method.

Similarly, acquiring the static lock only blocks other threads from invoking a static synchronized method; it does not block other threads from invoking an un-synchronized method, nor does it block them from invoking a synchronized instance method.
